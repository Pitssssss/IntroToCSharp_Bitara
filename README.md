Codac Logistics Delivery & Fuel Auditor (C# Console Application)
Project Overview

Prelim Activity 01 – IT Elective 2

The Codac Logistics Delivery & Fuel Auditor is a console application that tracks a driver’s weekly fuel expenses and delivery performance over five days. It demonstrates core C# concepts such as input validation, loops, arrays, and basic financial calculations to produce a simple audit report.

>Objectives
This project aims to gather driver data, record daily fuel expenses, compute totals and averages, evaluate fuel efficiency, and generate a clear summary report while applying fundamental C# programming logic.

>Program Features
Driver Profile & Distance Validation
  The program collects the driver’s name, weekly fuel budget, and total distance traveled. It uses decimal for monetary accuracy and double for distance values, with a while loop ensuring valid input before       continuing.

Fuel Expense Tracking
  Fuel costs for five days are stored in a one-dimensional array. A for loop collects each entry and updates the running total, keeping the code efficient and organized.

Performance Analysis
  The system computes total and average expenses, calculates fuel efficiency, and classifies performance using conditional statements. It also checks if spending stays within the weekly budget.

Audit Report
  A final report summarizes the driver’s details, expenses, efficiency rating, and budget status in a clear and readable format.

Technologies Used
  The application is built using C# and runs as a .NET console program, which can be executed in Visual Studio or through the .NET CLI.

How to Run the Program
  To run the program in Visual Studio, open the project or solution and press Start or F5 to build and execute the application.
  If using the .NET CLI, open a terminal, navigate to the project folder, build the project, and run it. The console will then prompt for inputs and display the audit report.

Project Structure
  The repository mainly contains Program.cs for the application logic and README.md for documentation.

Learning Outcomes
  The activity strengthened skills in data type selection, input validation, loops, arrays, conditional logic, and presenting computed results clearly in the console.

Possible Improvements
  Future updates could include multi-driver support, data storage, a graphical interface, and report export features.
